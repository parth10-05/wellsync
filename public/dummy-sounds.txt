SOUND FILE PLACEHOLDERS

The workout timer component references two sound files that need to be added to the public directory:

1. /beep.mp3 - A short beep sound for interval transitions
2. /alarm.mp3 - A more prominent alarm sound for timer completion

You should add actual MP3 files to the public directory for these sounds to work properly in production.

In the meantime, you can download royalty-free sound files from:

Or you can create them using a simple audio editor like Audacity.
